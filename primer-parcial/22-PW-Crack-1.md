# PW Crack 1

## Descripcion
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/12/level1.py) and you'll need the encrypted [flag](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/12/level1.flag.txt.enc) in the same directory too.

## Pistas
- To view the file in the webshell, do: `$ nano level1.py`
- To exit `nano`, press Ctrl and x and follow the on-screen prompts.
- The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
