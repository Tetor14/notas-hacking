# PW Crack 3

## Descripcion
Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/18/level3.py) and you'll need the encrypted [flag](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/18/level3.flag.txt.enc) and the [hash](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/18/level3.hash.bin) in the same directory too. There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

## Pistas
- To view the level3.hash.bin file in the webshell, do: `$ bvi level3.hash.bin`
- To exit `bvi` type `:q` and press enter.
- The `str_xor` function does not need to be reverse engineered for this challenge.
